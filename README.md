This is a Christmas personality quiz to help destress after a hectic day of studies/work. Do it with your friends and colleagues to find out which Christmas characters are a part of your group! (Appropriate for all ages:))

!! The images in the program are all imported therefore might be altered once the images are downloaded on your local device (ensure when downloaded, they remain as '.png' files !!

Start off by going to question 1 tab and clicking on the button to select your answer as shown below:

After clicking the answer for each button, you automatically move on to the next question tab (your answers are added up to the final bit to reveal your character!)

Once you have completed all the questions, click submit and a new tab with your answer will pop up under "Your character" tab on the top of the page

If help is needed, doc strings have been added to the functions. These can be called for if any issues arise. The console can also be refreshed in case the error "pyimage not found" shows up.
